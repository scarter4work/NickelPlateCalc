entry.programDescription.prompt=\n\nThis program calculates the thickness of a layer of nickel\n\
plating per one side of a workpiece.  You need to enter\n\
the dimensions of the piece you are plating and the\n\
before and after weights of the workpeice.  Depending\n\
on the total surface area to be plated will determine\n\
the number of amps current to use and how many amp-hours\n\
to plate for.\n 
entry.weight1.prompt=Enter the starting weight of the workpiece:
entry.width.prompt=Enter the width of the workpiece:
entry.length.prompt=Enter the length of the workpiece:
entry.nbrSides.prompt=Enter the number of sides to be plated (1 or 2):
entry.nbrPieces.prompt=Enter the total number of pieces to be plated:
entry.panelSize.prompt=Now we need to find the current and current density to use.\n\
\n\
Is the workpiece a coupon or panel?  A coupon is anything\n\
that is 12" x 12" or less.  If the workpiece is a coupon, select\n\
one.  If the workpiece is a panel, select two.\n\
\n\
Selection: (1=coupon, 2=panel)
entry.weight2.prompt=Enter the final weight of the workpiece:
entry.quit.prompt=Would you like to quit? (Y or N):

ouptut.surfaceArea=The total surface area to be plated is: {0} inches.
